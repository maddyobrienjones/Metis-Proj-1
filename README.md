# Welcome to the Project Benson repo!

This project works to answer the question: where should an SAT preparation company advertise? We approached this problem using MTA turnstile data and neighborhood data to figure out which stations would have the most traffic in neighborhoods that had a sufficient amount of children and were affluent enough to be able to afford an SAT course.
